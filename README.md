## Results Summary

This project analyzes FC Barcelona’s 2025 La Liga season performance using live match data from the Football-Data API. 
The script processes each game to calculate results, cumulative points, and venue type (home vs away), then visualizes 
the team’s progression throughout the season. It outputs both a CSV file of match data and a plotted graph for quick 
performance insight.
